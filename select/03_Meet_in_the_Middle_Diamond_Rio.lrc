[00:10.34] It was seven hundred fenceposts from your place to ours
[00:15.59] Neither one of us was old enough to drive a car
[00:20.89] Sometimes it was raining, sometimes it would shine
[00:26.35] We wore out that gravel road between your house and mine
[00:32.15] I'd start walking your way
[00:36.91] You'd start walking mine
[00:39.43] We'd meet in the middle
[00:41.56] 'Neath that old georgia pine
[00:44.75] We'd gain a lot of ground
[00:47.45] 'Cause we'd both give a little
[00:49.70] Ain't no road too long

[01:11.49] Under that old pine tree, you ought to see it now
[01:16.66] Standing in the back yard reminding me and you
[01:22.48] That if we don't see eye to eye there's something we can do
[01:51.98] 
[01:27.97] I'd start walking your way
[01:30.72] You'd start walking mine
[01:33.22] We'd meet in the middle

[01:38.86] We'd gain a lot of ground
[01:41.14] 'Cause we'd both give a little
[01:43.66] Ain't no road too long
[01:46.41] We meet in the middle
[01:56.91] 
[01:53.06] Babe I love the way we work it out
[01:56.58] That's what love's all about
[02:10.58] 
[02:00.06] I'd start walking your way
[02:02.15] You'd start walking mine
[02:04.83] We'd meet in the middle
[02:07.24] 'Neath that old georgia pine
[02:10.41] We'd gain a lot of ground
[02:12.38] 'Cause we'd both give a little
[02:15.44] Ain't no road too long
[02:18.39] We meet in the middle

[02:54.65] 
[02:52.13] I'd start walking your way
[02:55.12] You'd start walking mine
[02:57.64] We'd meet in the middle
[02:59.90] 'Neath that old georgia pine
[03:03.20] We'd gain a lot of ground
