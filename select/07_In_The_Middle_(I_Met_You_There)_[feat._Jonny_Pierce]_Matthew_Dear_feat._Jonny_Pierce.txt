As i see the . Dam
I ask you if you see . To split into
.Take on their own
Free like you like me upon the cheek drown

As i see the storm first way mean
And i'm juts . Through this .
The love i can't ...before us
Life it poor the .dreams come true

The wings will keep on crushing in
Sometimes we lose sometimes we win
You save me from myself again
But you don't know this will end
The wings keep from crushing in
Sometimes you lose sometimes you win
You save me from myself again
Baby i don't know how this will end

He wings keep from crushing in
Sometimes you lose sometimes you win
You save me from myself again
Baby i don't know how this will end
This will end, this will end
This will end, this will end
This will end
