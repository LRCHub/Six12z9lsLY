(Charles E. Calhoun)

Well, pick me a town in any clime
People like a rockin' time
Stay awake both day and night
And everybody's feeling good and right
Then throw me
Smack dab in the middle
Smack dab in the middle
Smack dab in the middle
Well, let me rock and roll to satisfy my soul

I want ten Cadillacs and a diamond mill
Ten suits of clothes all dressed to kill
Ten room house and-a some barbecue
And-a fifty chicks none over twenty-two
Then throw me
Smack dab in the middle
Smack dab in the middle
Smack dab in the middle
Well, let me rock and roll to satisfy my soul

I want a lotta bread and gangs of meat
Oodles of butter and something sweet
Gallons of coffee to wash it down
And bi-carbonated soda by the pound
Smack dab in the middle
Smack dab in the middle
Smack dab in the middle
Well, let me rock and roll to satisfy my soul

Well, I want a big jazz band, a lotta dancing girls
A street that's paved with natural pearl
Bring me a wagonload of bonds and stocks
And then open up the doors to Fort Knox
Then throw me
Smack dab in the middle
Smack dab in the middle
Smack dab in the middle
Well, let me rock and roll to satisfy my soul
Soul, soul, soul
Smack dab, smack dab, smack dab...
