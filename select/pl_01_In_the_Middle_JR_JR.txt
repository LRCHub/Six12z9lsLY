Hearts are bought, and sold by
money.
All will live in fours at double
time.
There's a million ways to die,
Thoughts that circle, leave you
paralyzed.
Standing in the fire.
Here I am in the middle of it.
I can't decide, 'cause I'm in
the middle,
I can't move on, I'm stuck to
the floor.
Move left, move right, shut up
and get up.
I just cant stop feeling lazy
baby.
I need a decider.
Help me out when I'm in the
middle.
Wars are won and lost by time,
Grass don't look green, when
you're color blind.
Our collector's, holding knives.
Reputations, leave you marked
for life.
Standing in the fire.
Here I am in the middle of it.
I can't decide, 'cause I'm in
the middle,
I can't move on, I'm stuck to
the floor.
Move left, move right, shut up
and get up.
I just cant stop feeling lazy
baby.
I need a decider.
Help me out when I'm in the
middle.
Oh, I know, I know.
Oh, I know, I do.
Standing in the fire.
Here I am in the middle of it.
I can't decide, 'cause I'm in
the middle,
I can't move on, I'm stuck to
the floor.
Move left, move right, shut up
and get up.
I just cant stop feeling lazy
baby.
I need a decider.
Help me out when I'm in the
middle.
I need a decider
I need a decider
I need a decider
